# PGAIML Class Project Notebooks Repository

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks I created for project assignments submitted during my post-grad [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning class](https://onlineexeced.mccombs.utexas.edu/online-ai-machine-learning-course). The class is offered by the University of Texas at Austin [McCombs School of Business](https://onlineexeced.mccombs.utexas.edu/), and spans a total of 10 graded modules covering a range of topics and cases studies in applied machine learning.

As these are class assignments, you'll see the progression of my skills throughout the program. Each of these projects is specifically designed and bounded to focus on the topic introduced in the module, so none of these are entirely suitable for real-world applications. They are simplified examples to learn specific concepts.

Many of the data sets for these assignments are publically available from sites like Kaggle; I've included links to the versions of the data I used to complete the assignment.

I was able to execute all of these notebooks in practical timeframes on a local desktop computer with a consumer - albeit upscale - GPU card. YMMV.

## Contents
### Project 1: Cardio Good Fitness
_Fundamentals of AIML_

__Objective:__ To execute preliminary data analysis by exploring the dataset and coming up with some basic observations about the data. Build customer profile to help capitalize based on it. Also, extract actionable insights that drive sales.

Specific skills include an introduction to Pandas, NumPy, various visualization and charting, and a methodolgy for exploratory data analysis.

### Project 2: Cars4U Project
_Supervised Learning: Regression_

__Objective:__ Using the Cars4U dataset, need to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.

Skills include EDA, the use of linear regression and regression assumptions, and the generation of specific business insights and recommendations.

### Project 3: AllLifeBank Personal Loan Campaign Modelling
_Supervised Learning: Classification_

__Objective:__ AllLifeBank dataset was used to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.

Skills included a thorough EDA, significant data pre-processing, the use of logistic regression, identifying optimal thresholds with the AUC-ROC curve, decision trees, and pruning strategies.

### Project 4: Credit card churn prediction
_Feature Selection, Model Selection and Tuning_

__Objective:__ To predict customers who may abandon credit card services and to gain insights on their motivation.

Skills include the use of cross-validation techniques, data regularization, deployment pipelines, hyper-parameter tuning and oversampling / downsampling techniques.

* Notebook: [Thera Bank Credit Card Churn Prediction](https://github.com/jreves/AIML_Projects/blob/main/Thera%20Bank%20Credit%20Card%20Churn%20Prediction.ipynb)

### Project 5: AllLife Bank Credit Card Customer Segmentation
_Unsupervised Learning_

__Objective:__ To identify different segments in the existing customer, based on their spending patterns as well as past interaction with the bank, using clustering algorithms, and provide recommendations to the bank on how to better market to and service these customers.

Skills include EDA, both K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques, and cluster profiling.

### Project 6: Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
_Ensemble Techniques_

__Objective:__ To help the marketing team in identifying the potential customers for certificates of deposit.

Skills include supervised learning, decision tree analysis, model evaluation, and ensemble methods including boosting.

### Project 7: Bank Customer Churn Prediction
_Introduction to Neural Networks_

__Objective:__ To help the operations team identify the customers that are more likely to churn by building an artificial Neural Network from scratch.
